In the section [The string and I](../data_string/), you learnt that a string can
be understood as a list of characters. You will come across lists again and
again as you delve deeper into Haskell. This section will discuss lists and
various operations to perform on them. Take the time to familiarize yourself
with lists. You can hug them and kiss them, but most important of all learn how
to use them.
