Recursion is the process where a concept is defined in terms of itself. A
recursive function is defined in such a way that the function calls itself. The
above might seem abstruse. We need some examples to concretize the theory. If
you have a set of Matryoshka dolls at hand, unpack a smaller doll out of a
larger doll as a visual analogy of recursion. Read on for more examples.
