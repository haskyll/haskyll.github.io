In the section [En garde!](../decide_guard/), we learnt that guarded equations
allow us to simulate the behaviour of the `switch` statement from languages such
as C, Java, and JavaScript. Guarded equations also behave similarly to the
`match` statement from Python. Below, we discuss another way to mimic the
`switch` and `match` statements.

<!--=========================================================================-->

## Brief case

Let's start with an example. An integer $n$ is even if it is a multiple of 2,
and odd otherwise. We write the latter as the following mathematical expression:

$$
\begin{equation}
\label{eqnParity}
p(n)
=
\begin{cases}
\text{even},& \text{if } n \bmod 2 = 0,\\[8pt]
\text{odd},& \text{otherwise}.
\end{cases}
\end{equation}
$$

In Haskell, we use the case expression to implement formula (\ref{eqnParity}).
Examine the code below:

:include: file="assets/src/decide/parity.hs", line=27:33

A case expression has the format specified below:

```haskell
case expression of
    pattern1 -> expression1
    pattern2 -> expression2
    ...
    patternN -> expressionN
    _        -> defaultExpression
```

We start a case expression with the keyword `case`, followed by an expression
`expression` that evaluates to one of a finite number of values. If the value
matches `pattern1`, then `expression1` is evaluated. In case the value matches
`pattern2`, then `expression2` is evaluated. And so on. The default pattern is
the wildcard `_`, which should be the last pattern of a case expression as a
means of catching all other patterns not handled by `pattern1` to `patternN`.
The wildcard pattern is equivalent to the `default` case in the `switch`
statement of C and JavaScript, and the case `_` in a Python `match` statement.

Let's compare the Haskell code above with implementations in other languages. In
C, expression (\ref{eqnParity}) can be implemented via a `switch` statement as
follows:

:include: file="assets/src/decide/parity.c", line=25:-

Here's a JavaScript implementation:

:include: file="assets/src/decide/parity.js", line=25:-

Python wants to join in the fun:

:include: file="assets/src/decide/parity.py", line=26:35

## Renaissance artists

Do you know which colour is associated with which ninja turtle? Donatello is
purple, Leonardo (da Vinci) is blue, Michelangelo is orange, and Raphael is red.
Given a name of a ninja turtle, we want to output the corresponding colour. Any
other name would not be recognized as the name of a ninja turtle. In case you
cannot remember the colour of a turtle, the function below might help:

:include: file="assets/src/decide/turtle.hs", line=28:36

Here's a slightly more difficult problem. Given a person's name, output the
first vowel in the name. Some names do not contain vowels at all, in which case
output the null character `'\0'`. The following code solves the above
problem. Similar to the script
:script: file="assets/src/decide/parity.hs"
, the code below illustrates that the wildcard pattern `_` is not required as
the final pattern in a case expression, provided we have covered all
possibilities.
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

:include: file="assets/src/decide/name.hs", line=25:38

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
The function `vowel` in the script
:script: file="assets/src/decide/name.hs"
is defined in terms of a list comprehension, a topic to be discussed in the
section [¿Comprende?](../list_comprehension/). Test the above code with these
Renaissance artists:
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

-   Albrecht Dürer
-   Andrea Mantegna
-   Donatello
-   Giovanni Bellini
-   Jan van Eyck
-   Leonardo da Vinci
-   Lorenzo Ghiberti
-   Michelangelo
-   Raphael
-   Sandro Botticelli

The following names do not have vowels at all. Use the names to test the above
code as well.

-   Brynn Ng
-   Gwynyth Symth

## Which one?

We conclude this section with a retrospective on the decision-making constructs
available in Haskell. Hitherto the chapter has discussed the following
techniques for decision-making:

1. Conditional expression
1. Guarded equation
1. Pattern matching
1. Case expression

Which technique should you choose? Generally, you should err on the side of
readability. A conditional expression is ideal for simple decision-making, where
the conditional is a short expression that allows you to fit an
`if...then...else` construct on one line, like the ternary operator in some
other languages. Some Haskell code formatter would automatically structure an
`if...then...else` across three lines, which defeats the purpose of a
conditional expression being like a ternary operator. You might as well use a
guarded equation instead of a conditional expression.

Pattern matching is ideal for the situation where you have a finite set of
values. Suppose you have the values $a_1,\, a_2,\, \dots,\, a_n$. With a guarded
equation you would test each value via a guard such as `| x == a1`. It is
tedious to write out all such conditionals, especially when you have three or
more conditionals. Your code can be simplified somewhat by using pattern
matching. Case expression and pattern matching are almost identical. Whenever
you can replace a case expression by pattern matching, do so. For everything
else, use a Master Car... err... a case expression.
