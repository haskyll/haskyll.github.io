Numbers are magnificent, but have you seen what can be done with strings? In
this section, we will discuss strings. In particular, how to split strings, join
strings, and manipulate them in other ways. We start off with characters in the
section [Characters](#characters) because a string can be conceptualized as a...
um... string of characters. The section [Strings](#strings) then discusses
common operations on strings. We will learn how to join strings together, split
a string apart, and embed strings and numbers into another string.
