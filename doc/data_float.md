We discuss floating-point numbers with emphasis on the data type
[`Double`][double]. The section
[Floating-point numbers](#floating-point-numbers) briefly presents basic
arithmetic operations on floating-pointing numbers. Building on from the section
[Printing numbers](../data_number/#printing-numbers), in the section
[Parsing numbers](#parsing-numbers) you will learn how to read a number from the
command line. The section [Convert from integers](#convert-from-integers)
discusses how to convert an integer to a floating-point number, whereas the
section [Convert from floating-points](#convert-from-floating-points) presents
subtle issues you would encounter when converting a floating-point number to an
integer.
