How many times do you find yourself unable to make up your mind about something?
Take the manual work out of decision making and let Haskell automate it for you.
Haskell provides various ways to help you construct a program that branches into
several paths, depending on whichever choice you make. The techniques are not
guaranteed to cure you of indecision, but at least make it seem like your
program knows when to be resolute.
