Hi! I'm a shouty man.[^a] Do you miss the `switch` statement from languages such
as C, Java, and JavaScript? Or the `match` statement from Python? Tired of
writing (or reading) nested conditional expressions like the following?

:include: file="assets/src/decide/nested.hs", name="nested.hs", line=11:16

Say no more. What if I tell you that you can get rid of nested conditional
expressions? How would you like to organize your nested conditional expressions
according to the cases or conditions you want to match? Curious? Read on.
