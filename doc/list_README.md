We have already covered a substantial amount of materials on list. In this
chapter, we will discuss more ways to construct and process lists. The range
notation made a cursory appearance in the chapter [Data, data everywhere][data].
In the section [Free range numbers][range], we will discuss in some detail a
number of methods to construct lists via the range notation. List comprehension,
as will be presented in the section [Â¿Comprende?][comprende], is one of the most
useful list construction and processing techniques to know. The usefulness of
list comprehension is due to its compact notation, which can be used to produce
lists of varying complexity. Finally, in the section [Bool-like][boolike] we
will consider some functions that are the list counterparts of the boolean
operators `&&` and `||`. These boolean-like functions allow us to answer many
yes-no questions about lists whose elements are not necessarily boolean values.
