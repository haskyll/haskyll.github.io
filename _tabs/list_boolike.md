The boolean operators `&&` and `||` take boolean values as their operands.
Sometimes you want to apply a boolean operator to a list of boolean values.
Writing something like `a && b && c && d && e` can quickly become unwieldy and
tedious. What you want are versions of `&&` and `||` that can operate on lists,
not necessarily of boolean values. Well, this is your lucky day. For a limited
time only starting from now to eternity, you can use various functional versions
of your favourite boolean operators. Too good to be `True`? Au contraire, mon
ami(e).

## and

The function [`and`][and] outputs `True` if all elements of a list are `True`,
and `False` otherwise. It is the function counterpart of the operator `&&`. The
function `and` is useful when we want to know whether all elements of a list
satisfy a given property. For example, below we check whether all elements of a
list are even.

```haskell
ghci> and [even x | x <- [1 .. 10]]
False
ghci> and [even x | x <- [2, 4 .. 10]]
True
ghci> and [even x | x <- [1, 3 .. 10]]
False
```

Pietro manages a pet shop. As part of his monthly routine, Pietro checks to see
whether all pets in his shop have had a health check within the last 12 months.
A number of new pets were delivered to the shop recently. Pietro does not recall
bringing the new pets to a veterinary clinic within the last two weeks. The
following shows the pets database and the health check status of all animals in
Pietro's shop.

[`pet.hs`](https://github.com/quacksouls/haskyll/blob/main/assets/src/list/pet.hs)
```haskell
import Data.Foldable
import Text.Printf

-- | Database of pets.  Each element in the database follows this format:
--
-- (pet-name, animal-type, health-check)
--
-- pet-name := The name of the pet.
-- animal-type := The type of animal, e.g. cat, dog, fish, etc.
-- health-check := Whether the pet has had a health check within the last
-- 12 months.
pet =
    [ ("Anonymouse", "mouse", False)
    , ("Cat Scan", "cat", True)
    , ("Catherine the Grater", "cat", True)
    , ("Charlie Chihuahua", "dog", True)
    , ("Chirpie O'Tweet", "bird", False)
    , ("Dogalogue", "dog", True)
    , ("Fido Dogstoevsky", "dog", True)
    , ("Frankie Frankfurt", "dog", True)
    , ("Garry Longtongue", "lizard", True)
    , ("Goldie Horn", "fish", False)
    , ("Hamsuke Hamton", "hamster", True)
    , ("Harry Speedbump", "hedgehog", True)
    , ("Hissy Fit", "cat", True)
    , ("Meowzart", "cat", True)
    , ("Mrs. Clucky", "bird", True)
    , ("Papa's New Guinea", "guinea pig", True)
    , ("Roam Ferret Roam", "ferret", True)
    , ("Robbie Hopster", "rabbit", True)
    , ("Scratchy Meowser", "cat", True)
    , ("Tabby Whiskers", "cat", True)
    , ("Terry Terrier", "dog", True)
    , ("Woofy McBark", "dog", True)
    ]

-- | Extract a particular type of animal from the database.
extract :: String -> [(String, String, Bool)]
extract "" = error "Cannot be empty string"
extract t  = filter (\(_, animal, _) -> animal == t) pet

-- | Whether a list of pets have had a health check within the last
-- 12 months.
hasHealthCheck :: [(String, String, Bool)] -> Bool
hasHealthCheck [] = False
hasHealthCheck xs = and [check | (_, _, check) <- xs]

-- | Managing a pets database.
main = do
    let animal =
            [ "bird"
            , "cat"
            , "dog"
            , "ferret"
            , "fish"
            , "guinea pig"
            , "hamster"
            , "hedgehog"
            , "lizard"
            , "mouse"
            , "rabbit"
            ]
    putStrLn "Health check status"
    printf "all pets -> %s\n" $ show . hasHealthCheck $ pet
    for_ animal $ \anim -> do
        let pt = extract anim
        putStr anim
        printf " -> %s\n" $ show . hasHealthCheck $ pt
```

<!--=========================================================================-->

## or

The function [`or`][or] outputs `True` if one element of a list is `True`. Like
its operator counterpart `||`, `or` outputs `False` if all elements are `False`.
The function `or` is useful in situations where we only care that one element is
`True`. It might be the case that multiple elements are `True`. However, we are
only interested in whether at least one element is `True`.

For example, the list of integers from 1 up to and including 10 has at least one
odd number. Similarly, the list `[1 .. 10]` has at least one even number. The
following GHCi session should confirm the above observations:

```haskell
ghci> or [even x | x <- [1 .. 10]]
True
ghci> or [odd x | x <- [1 .. 10]]
True
```

The vowels of the English alphabet are "A", "E", "I", "O", and "U". Some words
in English do not contain a vowel at all. Here are some common, and not so
common, words that consist of only consonants:

| C     | G     | P     | S      | T     | W    |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ------ | ----- | ---- |
| cry   | glyph | ply   | sty    | thy   | why  |
| crypt | gym   | pwn   | sync   | try   | wry  |
| cyst  | gypsy | pygmy | syzygy | tryst | wyrm |

If you were to test each of the above words for vowels, the result would be
`False`. Observe:

[`word.hs`](https://github.com/quacksouls/haskyll/blob/main/assets/src/list/word.hs)
```haskell
import Data.Foldable
import Text.Printf

-- | Some words in the English language that contain only consonants.
word =
    [ "cry"
    , "crypt"
    , "cyst"
    , "glyph"
    , "gym"
    , "gypsy"
    , "ply"
    , "pwn"
    , "pygmy"
    , "sty"
    , "sync"
    , "syzygy"
    , "thy"
    , "try"
    , "tryst"
    , "why"
    , "wry"
    , "wyrm"
    ]

-- | Whether a word has one or more vowels.
hasVowel :: String -> Bool
hasVowel str = or [s `elem` "aeiou" | s <- str]

-- | Test words to see whether they have vowels.
main = do
    let result = or $ map (\w -> hasVowel w) word
    printf "Any words have a vowel? %s\n" $ show result
    putStrLn "Test individual word for vowels"
    for_ word $ \w -> do
        printf "%s -> %s\n" w $ show . hasVowel $ w
```

<!--=========================================================================-->

## all

The function [`all`][all] is a predicate counterpart of [`and`][and]. Whereas
`and` expects all elements of a list to be boolean values, `all` accepts a
predicate that is used to determine whether all elements of a list satisfy the
predicate. For example, suppose we have a list of integers. We do not know
whether all the integers are positive. The function `all` can help us in this
scenario. Consider the GHCi session below:

```haskell
ghci> import Control.Monad
ghci> import System.Random.Stateful
ghci> ella <- replicateM 20 (uniformRM (-3, 20) globalStdGen :: IO Integer)
ghci> ellb <- replicateM 20 (uniformRM (-3, 20) globalStdGen :: IO Integer)
ghci> ellc <- replicateM 20 (uniformRM (1, 20) globalStdGen :: IO Integer)
ghci> ella
[1,2,15,12,1,10,17,-3,7,20,-3,3,8,8,14,19,11,-2,1,18]
ghci> all (\x -> x > 0) ella
False
ghci> ellb
[1,10,4,1,3,2,10,-1,6,4,20,0,4,-2,14,19,-3,18,16,13]
ghci> all (\x -> x > 0) ellb
False
ghci> ellc
[6,9,9,13,16,2,17,11,15,7,2,7,9,16,20,8,4,7,18,5]
ghci> all (\x -> x > 0) ellc
True
```

As another example, consider the table below of the [goals scored][arsenal] by
players of Arsenal during the 2022---2023 season of the Premier League. We
included only male players who scored at least one goal. The header "Goals-PK"
means non-penalty goals.

| Player              | Goals | Goals-PK |
| ------------------- | ----: | -------: |
| Ben White           |     2 |        2 |
| Bukayo Saka         |    14 |       12 |
| Eddie Nketiah       |     4 |        4 |
| Fabio Vieira        |     1 |        1 |
| Gabriel Dos Santos  |     3 |        3 |
| Gabriel Jesus       |    11 |       10 |
| Gabriel Martinelli  |    15 |       15 |
| Granit Xhaka        |     7 |        7 |
| Jakub Kiwior        |     1 |        1 |
| Leandro Trossard    |     1 |        1 |
| Martin Ødegaard     |    15 |       15 |
| Oleksandr Zinchenko |     1 |        1 |
| Rob Holding         |     1 |        1 |
| Reiss Nelson        |     3 |        3 |
| Thomas Partey       |     3 |        3 |
| William Saliba      |     2 |        2 |

Our question is: Were all the goals scored non-penalty? If a player scored $g$
goals and statistics says the player scored $h$ non-penalty goals, then all
goals scored by the player is non-penalty provided that $g = h$. I'm too lazy to
check by hand. Let's delegate the manual work to Haskell:

[`arsenal.hs`](https://github.com/quacksouls/haskyll/blob/main/assets/src/list/arsenal.hs)
```haskell
import Text.Printf

-- | Goals scored by male players of Arsenal during the 2022--2023
-- season of the Premier League. Each tuple follows the format
-- (name, goals, goals-pk), where
--
-- name := The name of the player.
-- goals := The number of goals the player scored.
-- goals-pk := The number of non-penalty goals scored.
goal =
    [ ("Ben White", 2, 2)
    , ("Bukayo Saka", 14, 12)
    , ("Eddie Nketiah", 4, 4)
    , ("Fabio Vieira", 1, 1)
    , ("Gabriel Dos Santos", 3, 3)
    , ("Gabriel Jesus", 11, 10)
    , ("Gabriel Martinelli", 15, 15)
    , ("Granit Xhaka", 7, 7)
    , ("Jakub Kiwior", 1, 1)
    , ("Leandro Trossard", 1, 1)
    , ("Martin Ødegaard", 15, 15)
    , ("Oleksandr Zinchenko", 1, 1)
    , ("Rob Holding", 1, 1)
    , ("Reiss Nelson", 3, 3)
    , ("Thomas Partey", 3, 3)
    , ("William Saliba", 2, 2)
    ]

-- | Were all the goals scored non-penalty?
main = do
    let testAll = all (\(_, g, p) -> g == p) goal
    let testAnd = and [g == p | (_, g, p) <- goal]
    let testOr = or [g == p | (_, g, p) <- goal]
    printf "(all) all non-penalty goals? %s\n" $ show testAll
    printf "(and) all non-penalty goals? %s\n" $ show testAnd
    printf "(or) some non-penalty goals? %s\n" $ show testOr
```

<!--=========================================================================-->

## any

The function [`any`][any] is the predicate counterpart of [`or`][or]. The
function `or` requires all elements of a list to be boolean values. On the other
hand, `any` requires a predicate based upon which the function decides whether
some elements of a list satisfy the predicate.

Consider a bunch of random integers. We know that there are negative integers
and zero. Is there at least one positive integer? Let's find out.

```haskell
ghci> import Control.Monad
ghci> import System.Random.Stateful
ghci> a <- replicateM 20 (uniformRM (-20, 3) globalStdGen :: IO Integer)
ghci> b <- replicateM 20 (uniformRM (-20, 2) globalStdGen :: IO Integer)
ghci> c <- replicateM 20 (uniformRM (-20, 0) globalStdGen :: IO Integer)
ghci> a
[-16,-14,-1,-16,-19,-4,-8,-19,-1,-5,-6,1,-7,-3,-8,-15,-4,-11,-17,-10]
ghci> any (\x -> x > 0) a
True
ghci> b
[2,-4,-5,-5,2,0,2,-1,-18,-14,-2,-15,-11,-20,-15,-11,0,-4,-14,-4]
ghci> any (\x -> x > 0) b
True
ghci> c
[-20,-17,-10,-1,-6,-6,-3,-4,-3,-3,-1,-8,-4,-7,-19,-14,0,-15,-1,-7]
ghci> any (\x -> x > 0) c
False
```

Violet wants to increase her vocabulary. The words in her list vary in length.
She wants to know whether the list has a short word, i.e. a word of at most 5
letters. Learning short words all the time is no fun. Violet also wants to
determine whether the list has a long word, i.e. a word of at least 8 letters.
Let's use Haskell to find out:

```haskell
ghci> a = ["benign", "elixir", "tumid", "intemperance", "narcissist"]
ghci> any (\str -> length str <= 5) a
True
ghci> any (\str -> length str >= 8) a
True
```

<strong>Exercise 3.</strong> Many words in English that do not have a vowel use the letter "Y" to simulate a
vowel sound. Refer to the script
[`word.hs`](https://github.com/quacksouls/haskyll/blob/main/assets/src/list/word.hs)
from the section [or](#or). Modify the script to determine whether some of the
words in the word list do not use "Y". Print such words to standard output.

<strong>Exercise 4.</strong> Recall the [exercise](../list_range/#exGilbreath) on
[Gilbreath's conjecture][GilbreathConjecture] from the section
[Free range numbers](../list_range/). Let $\ell$ be a list of prime numbers not
exceeding an integer $n > 1$. Successive application of the difference operation
would eventually result in the list `[1]`. Determine how many times you must
perform the difference operation in order to obtain a list that satisfies one of
the properties below:
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

-   All elements of the list are 1.
-   The list has a zero.
-   Each element of the list is either 0 or 1.
-   Each element of the list is either 0, 1, or 2.

The values of $n$ are drawn from the list `[10, 100, 1000, 10000, 100000]`.
