Do you like samurai? Do you like pizza? Do you like cats? If you answer yes to
all three questions, you might like [Samurai Pizza Cats][pizzaCats]. Do you also
like banana? Perhaps you might be interested in [Bananya][bananya]. Questions
such as the above often require a yes/no answer. Yes means true, you prefer
something. No means false, you dislike something. Questions or statements that
can be answered with yes/no or true/false are said to have boolean values.
Haskell models boolean values via the type [`Bool`][bool], which has two defined
values: `True` and `False`.

What else can you do with boolean values? A simple operation is to use the
function [`not`][not] to negate a boolean value, thus resulting in the opposite
value. The result of `not True` is `False` because the opposite of `True` is
`False`. As you might have already guessed, the result of `not False` is `True`.

Given a bunch of boolean values, you can use the Haskell boolean operators
[`||`][or] and [`&&`][and] to calculate boolean results.[^a] The operator `||`
means "or", i.e. logical disjunction. In everyday English usage, the word "or"
means "either this or that". In computer programming, "or" means "this or that
or both", i.e. inclusive or. The following table should help to clarify the
meaning of `||` and its effect when given two boolean values. The table below
uses `OR` instead of `||` because Markdown cannot properly convert `||` when
used within a table.

| `OR`    | `False` | `True` |
| :------ | :------ | :----- |
| `False` | `False` | `True` |
| `True`  | `True`  | `True` |

From the above table, the result of `False || True` is `True`, so is
`True || True`. The one and only occasion when `||` returns `False` is when both
operands are `False`. Take a moment to use the above table and work through the
output of the following program.

[`or.hs`](https://github.com/quacksouls/haskyll/blob/main/assets/src/data/or.hs)
```haskell
import Text.Printf

-- | Boolean or.
main = do
    let coffee = True
    let tea = False
    let water = True
    let beer = False
    printf "Coffee or tea? %s\n" $ show (coffee || tea)
    printf "Tea or water? %s\n" $ show (tea || water)
    printf "Tea or beer? %s\n" $ show (tea || beer)
```

## Dollar sign

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
Hang on. What is the dollar sign [`$`][dollarSign] doing in the program
[`or.hs`](https://github.com/quacksouls/haskyll/blob/main/assets/src/data/or.hs)
? In Haskell, the symbol `$` is the function application operator. Given a
function `f` and an argument `x`, the result of applying `f` on `x` is written
in Haskell as `f x`. Using the operator `$` in prefix notation, we can write
`($) f x` for the same effect. See for yourself.
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

```haskell
ghci> negate 5
-5
ghci> ($) negate 5
-5
ghci> head "8-)"
'8'
ghci> ($) head "8-)"
'8'
ghci> div 9 2
4
ghci> ($) div 9 2
4
```

At first glance, it seems like the operator `$` is redundant. Why should it even
exist? A short answer is that `$` allows us to write readable code by avoiding
(nested) parentheses as much as possible. Let's consider an example. To satisfy
your daily mathematics fix, you evaluate the expression $2 \times (4 + 3)$
to 14. You know that anything within parentheses must be calculated first, then
multiply the result by 2. The symbol `$` allows you to tell Haskell to evaluate
the expression within parentheses first. Here are equivalent ways to evaluate
$2 \times (4 + 3)$ in Haskell.

```haskell
ghci> 2 * (4 + 3)
14
ghci> (*) 2 $ 4 + 3
14
```

The operator `$` means that Haskell should treat the right-hand side of `$` as
an operand of `*`. In general, the function application operator `$` directs
Haskell to first evaluate or process whatever expression is to the right of `$`.
Whenever you have an expression that involves `$`, you should try in your mind
to parse the expression from right to left instead of the usual left to right.
The examples below should clarify how to use `$`.

```haskell
ghci> import Text.Printf
ghci> tail (init "8caterpillar-")
"caterpillar"
ghci> tail $ init "8caterpillar-"
"caterpillar"
ghci> printf "Quotient is %d\n" (div 11 3)
Quotient is 3
ghci> printf "Quotient is %d\n" $ div 11 3
Quotient is 3
ghci> head (tail (tail "abcdef"))
'c'
ghci> head $ tail $ tail "abcdef"
'c'
```

## And

The boolean operator [`&&`][and] means "and", i.e. logical conjunction. Its
result is `True` provided that both operands are `True`. Its result is `False`
for all other cases. The table below helps to clarify the effect of `&&`.

| `&&`    | `False` | `True`  |
| :------ | :------ | :------ |
| `False` | `False` | `False` |
| `True`  | `False` | `True`  |

Unlike the expression `True || False`, the result of `True && False` is `False`.
The only time when `&&` returns `True` is the expression `True && True`. Again,
take some time to work through the boolean results of the following program.

[`and.hs`](https://github.com/quacksouls/haskyll/blob/main/assets/src/data/and.hs)
```haskell
import Text.Printf

-- | Boolean and.
main = do
    let coffee = True
    let tea = False
    let water = True
    let beer = False
    printf "Coffee and tea? %s\n" (show (coffee && tea))
    printf "Coffee and water? %s\n" (show (coffee && water))
    printf "Tea and beer? %s\n" (show (tea && beer))
```

<strong>Exercise 4.</strong> Examine the terminal session below. Determine which food Tabby dislikes. Write a
program that uses boolean operators to achieve the same output as in the terminal
session.
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

```sh
$ ghc food.hs && ./food
[1 of 2] Compiling Main             ( food.hs, food.o )
[2 of 2] Linking food
Tabby likes fish or cheese? True
Tabby likes fish and cheese? False
```

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
<strong>Exercise 5.</strong> Both of the types [`Bool`][bool] and [`Int`][int] are based on [`Enum`][enum],
as can be verified by the output of the GHCi commands `:info Bool` and
`:info Int`. The method [`fromEnum`][fromEnum] can be used to convert a boolean
value to its corresponding integer value: `True` becomes 1, `False` becomes 0. A
quiz has four questions: a, b, c, and d. Your results for the quiz are given
below. The value `True` means you answered a question correctly and `False`
means otherwise. Use the boolean values and the method `fromEnum` to calculate
how many questions you answered correctly.
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

```haskell
ghci> a = True
ghci> b = False
ghci> c = True
ghci> d = True
```

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
<strong>Exercise 6.</strong> The word "or" in everyday English means, "Either this or that, but not both." In
computer programming, the latter meaning of "or" is called exclusive or, often
abbreviated as XOR. Given two boolean values `a` and `b`, the boolean operator
XOR is defined in terms of `||` and `&&` as the expression
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

```haskell
(a || b) && not (a && b)
```

Fortunately, you do not need to use the above expression whenever you want to
calculate the XOR of two boolean values. The package [`Data.Bits`][dataBits] has
the method [`xor`][xor]. Write a program that uses `xor` to achieve the same
output as shown in the terminal session below.

```sh
$ ghc pet.hs && ./pet
[1 of 2] Compiling Main             ( pet.hs, pet.o )
[2 of 2] Linking pet
Sam likes cats and dogs? False
Sam likes cats or dogs? True
Sam likes cats XOR dogs? True
```

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
<strong>Exercise 7.</strong> Modify the following program so the expression `likeCat && likeTiger` returns
`False`.
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

[`pet.hs`](https://github.com/quacksouls/haskyll/blob/main/assets/src/data/pet.hs)
```haskell
import Text.Printf

-- | Pet preference.
main = do
    let likeCat = True
    let likeDog = True
    let likeTiger = True
    let likeWolf = False
    printf "Sam likes cats and dogs? %s\n" $ show $ likeCat && likeDog
    printf "Sam likes tiger or wolf? %s\n" $ show $ likeTiger || likeWolf
    printf "Sam likes cat or tiger? %s\n" $ show $ likeCat || likeTiger
    printf "Sam likes cat and tiger? %s\n" $ show $ likeCat && likeTiger
```

<strong>Exercise 8.</strong> Given two boolean values `a` and `b`, [De Morgan's laws][deMorgan] are the
statements:
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

```haskell
not (a || b) == (not a) && (not b)
not (a && b) == (not a) || (not b)
```

Verify the above statements yourself for various boolean values of `a` and `b`.

<strong>Exercise 9.</strong> Sam is using a search engine to find pet images. The search query is, "cat or
dog". Provide an equivalent boolean expression for Sam's query.
