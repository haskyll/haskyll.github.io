Haskell comes in various implementations. The implementation used in this book
is the [Glasgow Haskell Compiler][ghc] (GHC). Refer to the
[installation][install] instructions for your specific platform, e.g. FreeBDS,
Linux, macOS, Windows. Many operating systems provide GHC as part of their
respective package managers. The main benefit of installing GHC via the native
package manager of your platform is that you do not need to worry about
installing any other dependencies required by GHC. However, the downside is
that the version offered by the package manager is usually out of date.
Alternatively, you can use [GHCup][ghCup] to install the latest, or a specific,
version of GHC.

## Exercises

<strong>Exercise 1.</strong> Use the package manager of your operating system to install GHC.

<strong>Exercise 2.</strong> Install GHCup on your computer.
